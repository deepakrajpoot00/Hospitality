File Upload Handling:
           The home route in app.py handles both GET and POST requests.
           On a POST request, the uploaded CSV files are saved to the uploads directory.
Processing CSV Files:
           The process_files function reads the group and hostel information from the uploaded CSV files using Pandas.
           It checks for required columns and raises an error if any are missing.
           The function filters hostels by gender and sorts them by remaining capacity.
           It allocates rooms to groups based on availability and capacity, recording allocation details.
Displaying Results:
           The allocation results are passed to the result.html template for display.
           A download link for the allocation details CSV file is provided.
Error Handling:
           If required columns are missing from the CSV files, a KeyError is raised and a meaningful error message is displayed.
